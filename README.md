# Graphing Vapour Pressure as a Function of Temperature 
Generating graphs of vapour pressure vs. tempearture graphs using Antoine's equation. The app can be viewed here: https://share.streamlit.io/thomaslee01/vapourpressuregraph and was developed using Python for the backend, [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the front end and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) for the graph generations. There still may be a few bugs that made it past me but so far everything is working okay. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Windows 10:

Ensure that you have dependencies installed from requirements.txt above and from the directory of streamlit_app.py, open cmd.exe and enter:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Example
Below is an example of how to use the app itself when viewed via [here](https://share.streamlit.io/thomaslee01/vapourpressuregraph) or through a
local server through localhost.
